# preprint-scraping
Repo to pull + store new materials being released

NOTE: running the last few lines of code will take hours given the volume of pdfs and time required to scrape them. If you want to grab the pdfs, please initialize a new folder called "bibstuff" and drop a file in and then it will run! Otherwise, comment out the code.
